= Getting Started Quickly

This section demonstrates basic JPA concepts through a simple example program.
After reading this section you should be able to write basic programs performing CRUD operations (Create/Store, Retrieve, Update and Delete) on a database.

The example program that this section presents manages a simple database that contains points in the plane.

Each point is represented by an object with two int fields, `int x` and `int y`, that hold the point's x and y coordinates.

The program demonstrates CRUD database operations by storing, retrieving, updating and deleting Point objects.
